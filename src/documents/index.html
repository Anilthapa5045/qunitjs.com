	<div class="col2-1">
		<h2>What is QUnit?</h2>
		<p>
			QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use, JavaScript test suite. It's used by the jQuery project to test its code and plugins but is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code (and even capable of testing JavaScript code on the server-side).
		</p>
		<p>
			QUnit is especially useful for regression testing: Whenever a bug is reported, write a test that asserts the existence of that particular bug. Then fix it and commit both. Every time you work on the code again, run the tests. If the bug comes up again - a regression - you'll spot it immediately and know how to fix it, because you know what code you just changed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Having good unit test coverage makes safe refactoring easy and cheap. You can run the tests after each small refactoring step and always know what change broke something.
		</p>
		<p>
			QUnit is similar to other unit testing frameworks like JUnit, but makes use of the features JavaScript provides and helps with testing code in the browser, eg. with its stop/start facilities for testing asynchronous code.

		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            To get started, let’s look at a minimal QUnit testsuite, the Hello World of QUnit:
        </p>
        {% codeblock lang:html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>QUnit Tests</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="qunit.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 id="qunit-header">QUnit Hello World</h1>
        <h2 id="qunit-banner"></h2>
        <ol id="qunit-tests"></ol>
        <script src="qunit.js"></script>
        <script>
            test("hello", function() {
                ok(true, "world");
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
        {% endcodeblock %}

	</div>

	<div class="col2-1">
	     <p>
            This is a very minimalistic testsuite. It declares a doctype, includes the CSS and JS files for QUnit, defines another script element with a single QUnit test and assert, and a little bit of additional markup for QUnit to output testresults. The call to the test() function defines a test with the name of “hello”. QUnit will then run this test once the page has loaded. The second argument, a function passed to test(), contains the actual testcode to run, here a call to ok(). The first argument defines if the assertion passes or not, the second specifies a message to output. In this case, the boolean true will always pass, as we’re not yet testing anything really.
        </p>
		<p>The #qunit-header element should contain the name of the testsuite, and won't be modified by QUnit. The #qunit-banner element will change based on the results of the test abd will show up as red if a test failed or green, if all tests passed. The #qunit-userAgent elements is used to display the navigator.userAgent property. The #qunit-tests element will be used as a container for the test results.</p>

		<p>The #qunit-fixture element can be used to provide and manipulate test markup, and will automatically be reset after each test (<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit/QUnit.reset">see QUnit.reset</a>). The element is styled with position:absolute; top:-10000px; left:-10000; - with these, it won't be obstructing the result, without affecting code that relies on the affected elements to be visible (instead of display:none). Older QUnit versions would only work with the #main element, which is deprecated, but still supported. It just won't get any default styles.</p>
